# Real Estate Transaction Analyzer üè†

---

## Project Overview
The **Real Estate Transaction Analyzer** is a Streamlit-based tool designed to streamline the process of reviewing and labeling real estate transactions for newsworthiness. Developed as part of the **[JournalismAI Fellowship](https://www.journalismai.info/programmes/fellowship)** in collaboration with the Globe & Mail, Hearst, Gannett and E24, this tool empowers journalists and analysts to interact with machine learning output, refine predictions, and feed labeled data back into BigQuery.

## Features
1. **BigQuery Integration**:
   - Fetches data processed by a newsworthiness prediction model.
   - Allows users to label transactions directly in the app, saving feedback back to BigQuery.

2. **Interactive UI**:
   - Displays transaction details in an intuitive table. 
   - Provides filters for district, property type, price range, and more.

3. **Labeling and Feedback**:
   - Displays the details of an individual transaction.
   - Allows users to mark transactions as "Newsworthy" (üëç) or "Not Newsworthy" (üëé).
   - Allows users to add optional written feedback, all of which is updated in BigQuery.
